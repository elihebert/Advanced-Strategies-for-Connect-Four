# Advanced-Strategies-for-Connect-Four
Implement advanced algorithmic strategies for playing Connect Four, a classic two-player connection game.

# Project: Advanced Strategies for Connect Four
# Overview
This project aims to explore and implement advanced algorithmic strategies for playing Connect Four, a classic two-player connection game. The project involves developing three versions of the minimax algorithm to understand their impacts on game strategy and performance. These include a basic minimax algorithm, minimax with alpha-beta pruning, and minimax with alpha-beta pruning enhanced by heuristic evaluation.

# Initial Setup
Starter Code: Starter code in Java and Python is provided, featuring a data model for the Connect Four board. This code serves as a foundation, which you can expand upon.
Optional User Gameplay: An initial optional task involves creating a user-playable version of Connect Four, facilitating familiarity with the game mechanics and the provided codebase.

# Project Components
# Basic Minimax
Implement the minimax algorithm with a transposition table to evaluate game outcomes thoroughly.
Focus on accurately calculating terminal state values and exploring the complete game tree for deterministic outcomes.

# Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
Enhance the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to efficiently trim the search tree and handle larger game configurations.
Incorporate move ordering (left-to-right) to facilitate pruning and match predetermined output formats for comparison.

# Heuristic-Enhanced Minimax
Introduce heuristic evaluation in conjunction with alpha-beta pruning to assess unfinished game states.
Allow dynamic adjustment of the search depth, reflecting a more human-like approach to playing the game by evaluating potential future moves.

# Functional Requirements
Unified Program: A single program interface that lets users select which algorithmic strategy to explore (Part A, B, or C).
Debugging Information: Option to display debugging information, including transposition table contents, to aid in understanding algorithmic decisions.
Game Customization: Users can define the game board size, the winning token sequence length, and choose which player (human or computer) moves first.
Interactive Gameplay: Following algorithmic analysis, users can play against the computer, leveraging the insights gained from the selected strategy.

# Algorithmic Details
Transposition Table: Utilize a transposition table in all parts to memorize previously evaluated game states, enhancing efficiency.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Apply alpha-beta pruning in Parts B and C to significantly reduce the search space without affecting the outcome.
Heuristic Evaluation: In Part C, design and implement a heuristic function to estimate the value of game states beyond a specified search depth.

# Game Dynamics
The computer's moves are based on the selected algorithmic strategy, aiming for optimal play based on the current game state.
Debugging outputs, including minimax values and optimal actions, provide insights into the computer's decision-making process.
# Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive exploration into algorithmic game playing strategies for Connect Four. Through incremental development—from basic minimax to advanced heuristic evaluations—participants will gain a deep understanding of how different algorithms affect gameplay strategy and computational efficiency.
